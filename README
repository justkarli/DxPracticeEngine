This project is a practical playground for me to learn managed directx with the help of slimdx. 

The goal is to build my own practical engine step by step using c# as programming language to learn by
practice how an engine can work and later, how special rendering effects work. 

External lib which is needed to build the project (SlimDx) is already in the repo.
